SpriteDragging, presented with Cocos2d Objective-C (in Swift)
===================================================

I uploaded this project as a sort of guide, not necessary a
library or a framework. The idea is to be able to use a touch
device and be able to drag a sprite or node in the location
of the location of the the finger dragged on the screen.

This can be very easily translated into SpriteKit, as I
have done with other projects. This technique has many uses
such as physics games, puzzles, or ordering layers for
regular applications. The ideas are limitless.


Where to download CocosBuilder? Follow these instructions:

git clone https://github.com/oxeron/cocosbuilder
cd CocosBuilder
git submodule update --init --recursive

Open up the Xcode project file in ./cocosbuilder/CocosBuilder
Do not change any recommended settings, just click “Build” and move the
app into your applications folder.

Enjoy!
